# 18499-quick-start-dynamic-ingest-api-dynamic-delivery
This quick start will help familiarize you with operations available via the Dynamic Ingest API. The Dynamic Ingest API enables you to ingest videos and associated media assets into Video Cloud.  Note that this sample is for accounts using the Dynamic Delivery system. If your account uses the legacy ingest system, see the Legacy Ingest version instead.
